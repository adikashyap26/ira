                                <p>In recent times, we have seen that chemicals play a major role in agriculture and
                                    horticulture. These chemicals include inorganic fertilizers, pesticides, growth
                                    enhancers etc. These might result in improving agricultural yield in the short term,
                                    leading to better profits. However, these chemicals used in agricultural fields
                                    contribute to the rupturing of soil structure and polluting the surroundings,
                                    thereby damaging the environment. The chemical fertilizers lead to lowering of the
                                    soil quality, thereby necessitating a continuous supply of chemicals for improving
                                    the yield. On consuming such chemical treated plant products, humans, animals and
                                    birds succumb to various diseases and finally to death. People tried to switch to
                                    Organic fruits, vegetables and cereals to overcome this. However, they were unsure
                                    whether the products were really grown using the pure organic materials.</p>
                                <p>Recognising the need for a pure organic nutrient/supplements which would enhance
                                    yield, with minimum water usage and be tasty and nutritious, Dr Suman Kashyap
                                    started to think of innovative ways to solve the problem. She wanted to devise an
                                    innovative product to help and nourish soil, help natural growth and development of
                                    plants and its products and to protect the environment. She wanted a product devised
                                    scientifically, but be accepted and adopted by traditional farming community.
                                    Consequently, this Organic Plant Medium would reduce the risk of exposing humans and
                                    other living creatures to various diseases and the damage caused to mother earth.
                                </p>
                                <p>To put scientific theory into a product that could be generalized, Dr Suman Kashyap
                                    founded IRA PLANT BIOTECH - Healthy Solutions for Healthy Life, in April 2023. The
                                    primary focus of IRA PLANT BIOTECH is to supply plant growth supplements for the
                                    growth and development of plants in a natural way. IRA PLANT BIOTECH products use
                                    constructs of Biotechnology, Vermitechnology and Nanotechnology. Products like IRA
                                    PLANT -PEARLS, SHILAJIT AND APAS and many more to follow in future, will play a
                                    significant role in the organic farming of varieties of vegetables, fruits,
                                    flowering plants, ornamentals, desert plants (cactus) and field crops viz., rice,
                                    millets etc. These products will help in enhancing the fertility of the soil,
                                    nourishing the plants and its produce. With continued scientific research and
                                    customised media development, IRA PLANT BIOTECH will be focusing on the development
                                    of wide range of products that are engineered to suit various agro-climatic
                                    conditions, thus enabling us to cater to domestic as well as international markets.
